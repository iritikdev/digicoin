# Project Description: DigiCoin App - Real-Time Crypto Price and News Updates

DigiCoin is a mobile application built using React and Material-UI (MUI) that provides real-time updates on the cryptocurrency market. The app sources its data from RapidAPI, a trusted and reliable API provider that delivers accurate and up-to-date information on crypto prices and news from a range of authentic sources.

The DigiCoin app is designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience, with a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and customization. Users can choose to view the latest prices and news on specific cryptocurrencies, or they can view a comprehensive overview of the entire market.

The app's real-time pricing information includes the current market value, price change percentage, and trading volume for each cryptocurrency. Users can also access historical price data and trends to gain deeper insights into the market's performance.

In addition to price updates, DigiCoin also provides users with the latest news from top crypto news sources such as CoinDesk, CryptoSlate, and Cointelegraph. The app's news section is regularly updated with breaking news, analysis, and opinion pieces, ensuring that users stay informed on the latest developments in the crypto industry.

Overall, the DigiCoin app provides a reliable and convenient way for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to stay up-to-date on the latest market developments, with real-time pricing information and news updates from authentic sources, all accessible from a user-friendly interface.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
